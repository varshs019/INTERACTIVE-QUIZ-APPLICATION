## Task 1: Responsive Webpage
The task was to design and develop a completely responsive webpage that can reshaped to different screens and devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The main technologies used to complete the task were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The emphasis was on a layout that is visually appealing, but also usable and accessible on all platforms.Â 
The process started with planning where to place content on the page. We started with semantic HTML elements like  Doing this made it easier to keep the content organized and made it easier for assistive technology to identify the page structure. During the design process it was really helpful to use sketch to think through the different responsive states and layouts of the project. Once the HTML layout was complete we were able to experiment with the layout using CSS media queries to change the layout, font sizes and spacing in relation to the width of the device screens. For example, we changed from a navigation menu to hamburger menus in some small viewports and adjusted the grid layouts to stack vertically when viewed on mobile screens.
We added JavaScript to make the changes to the navigations menu, and many additional features that changed the content dynamically and provided feedback on user actions. All of the colors, fonts, and user controls were considered providing color contrast, readability, and touch friendly sites to all users. The final deliverable is a webpage with outstanding responsive features

## Task 2: SPA Landing Page Redesign
Task 2: Redesign a Website Landing Page as a Single Page Application 
The second task was to take an existing website landing page and re-design it as a Single Page Application (SPA), improving usability and user experience, and modernizing its overall appearance. The project had the goal of updating the feel of the landing page, making it visually appealing, and easier to use. As with any redesign, the design team needed to go through the design process, starting with assessing the current website, listing what worked and what did not, and making notes of concerns, such as old design styles, difficult navigation, not responsive, and overall usability concerns. 
The team built a new SPA using semantic HTML5, modern CSS (Flexbox and Grid), and JavaScript for dynamic content management without a full page reload. The team created a sticky navigation bar at the top of the page with clear visual elements that allowed users to navigate the site at any time. The landing page was updated with modern color palettes and typography, improving visual appeal and overall readability. 
While usual enhancements such as smooth scrolling, animated transitions, and interactive design components were made to promote an enhanced user experience, the SPA also allowed for faster navigation and an application-style feel that modern users have come to expect from websites. Screenshots of the before and after are included to show a visual cue of the improvements, and a

## Task 3: Mobile App UI/UX Redesign
The third task addressed UI/UX design for a mobile app. The objective of this task is to reconsider the UI/UX design for a well-liked mobile app and to identify a specific user pain point that hinders the user's enjoyment or efficiency with that app. After careful consideration, I chose the YouTube mobile app and identified the pain point of how difficult it is to organize saved or watched videos.
I proposed that YouTube add a "Collections" feature that allows users to create folders for themselves so they could organize their saved videos by topic or interest (Music, Recipes, Study, etc.) The mockups illustrated how the user would add videos to their collections from the video page and how they would access those organized collections from the Library tab. The redesign emphasized interactions that are more instinctual, ie. dragging and dropping to organise and making folders with ease.
These mockups came with a thorough explanation of how the feature improves organisation, efficiency and personalisation for the users. The redesign focused on a real user pain point, demonstrating a user-centred approach to mobile app design and making the app more enjoyable and effective for its audience.

## Task 4: AR/VR Application User Interface Mockup
The focus of the fourth task was designing the User Interface of an AR/VR application with an emphasis on intuitive and natural interactions. A new user interface is not needed for all AR/VR applications, but the concept of new interfaces is important, especially for new interactions in AR/VR. The chosen AR/VR scenario was an interior design app using AR to place and arrange virtual furniture in users' own spaces using a device's camera. The UI was limited to the essentials, and interaction with the UI was focused on direct manipulation of objects through touch. 
Mock-ups were created for the primary AR view in which users would drag, scale, and rotate virtual furniture using familiar gestures. Users would tap a floating action button to add a new furniture item to the space, with undo and redo buttons for errors, while furniture menus would slide up from the bottom of the screen compartmentalizing icons for a variety of items that could be added to the user's scene.
The explanation of the design focused on direct manipulation, limited and necessary UI clutter, and easy, intuitive access to useful capabilities. Recognizing that clarity, ease, and intuitive nature of interaction for all users (regardless of technology background) was an important aspect of making the magic of AR technology accessible to everyone, without assuming a technology background.
